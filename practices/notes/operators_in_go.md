Operators:

```bash
Operators are the foundation of any programming language.
Operators allow us to perform different kinds of operations on operands.
In the Go language, operators Can be categorized based on their different functionality:

  * Arithmetic Operators
  * Relational Operators
  * Logical Operators
  * Bitwise Operators
  * Assignment Operators
  * Misc Operators


Note: We can define Operators in symbols.

Example, when we say 
a + b
// a, b -> are operands
// + -> Operators

In Go lang, we have '5' types of Operators:
1) Comparison Operators
   Example: == != < <= > >=
    equal ==
    not equal !=
    less than <
    less than or equal to <=
    greater than >
    greater than or equal to >=

2) Arithmetic Operators
   Example:  + - * / % ++ --
3) Assignment Operators
   Example: = += -= *= /= %=
4) Bitwise Operators
   Example: & | <<  >> ^
5) Logical Operators
   Example: && || !

1) Comparison Operators:
=========================
* compare two operands and yield a Boolean value.
* allow values of the same data type for comparisons
    Return True if it matches the condition. 
    Return False if doesn't matches the condition.
# Common Comparisons:
  * Does one string match another?
  * Are two numbers the same?
  * Is one number greater than another

In comparison Operators are,
equal ==
not equal !=
less than <
less than or equal to <=
greater than >
greater than or equal to >=
