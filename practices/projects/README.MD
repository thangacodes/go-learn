``bash

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/thangacodes/go-learn.git

2. Navigate to the 'Project' folder where 'main.go' and the Dockerfile are located:
   cd go-learn/practices/projects/
   ls -la

3. You may see a file called 'automated_process.sh'. Execute it by running:
    sh automated_process.sh

Note: Whenever it asks for user input, provide the required details.

4. Finally, access the web content in your local browser:

    * http://localhost:10000/about 
    * http://localhost:10000/contact
