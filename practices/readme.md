How do I compile and run a Go program? Please follow the instructions:

```bash
1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/thangacodes/go-learn.git

2. Navigate to the directory where the Go program exists
   cd practices
   ls -l
   go build -o helloworld main.go
   ls -l
   chmod a+x helloworld  #  Granting execute permission to the file named 'helloworld' for all users
   ./helloworld
   
3. You will see the output below after you run the compiled Go program.
   Hello World!

4. Always keep high hopes for yourself when you learn something new :)
