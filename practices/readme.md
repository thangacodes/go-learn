How do I compile and run a Go program? Please follow the instructions:

```bash
1. Clone the repository
      git clone https://github.com/thangacodes/go-learn.git
2. Navigate to the directory where the Go program exists
      cd practices
      ls -l
      go build -o hw main.go
      ls -l
      chmod a+x hw
      ./hw
        //You will see the output below after you run the compiled Go program.
          Hello World!
          Always keep high hopes for yourself when you learn something new :)
